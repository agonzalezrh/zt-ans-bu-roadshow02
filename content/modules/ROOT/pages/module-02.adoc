== Scenario 02: Standardized Consistency (Continued)

=== Introduction

Excellent work on the initial deployment! However, as often happens in IT operations, requirements have evolved. You've received an updated ticket that builds upon your existing infrastructure.

.Updated Support Ticket #003

Now that you have a functioning domain, Windows systems, and a new RHEL system deployed, it's time to complete the environment setup by managing user accounts, organizational units, and domain membership across your hybrid infrastructure.

=== Lab Environment Setup

Your DNS domain for this lab is: *[[ Instruqt-Var key="DOMAIN" hostname="control" ]]*

== Lab Exercises

=== Exercise 1: Creating Organizational Units and User Accounts

Active Directory requires proper organizational structure to manage users and resources effectively. You'll create the necessary organizational units and groups for your development teams.

==== Step 1: Deploy Active Directory Structure

. Navigate to *Automation Execution* → *Templates*
. Launch the *Windows Users and OU* template

[NOTE]
====
This template may appear on page 2 of your template list, depending on your screen resolution.
====

==== Step 2: Configure Organizational Details

When prompted, provide the following configuration details:

* *OU:* `Testing`
* *Group:* `TMM-Dev`

. Click *Next* and *Finish* to start the job

The automation will create the organizational structure and populate it with the necessary user accounts and groups for your development environment.

==== Step 3: Verify Active Directory Configuration

Once the job completes, verify the configuration on your domain controller:

. Navigate to the `windows` tab
. Click the *Start/Windows* button
. Select *Windows Administrative Tools* → *Active Directory Users and Computers*
. Expand the domain structure

Confirm that the following have been successfully created:
- Testing OU (Organizational Unit)
- TMM-Dev group
- Developer user accounts

=== Exercise 2: Domain Membership Management

With your Active Directory structure in place, you need to join both Windows and Linux systems to the domain for centralized management and authentication.

==== Windows Server Domain Join

===== Step 1: Join Windows Server to Domain

. Navigate back to your `aap` tab
. Go to *Automation Execution* → *Templates*
. Launch the *Windows Join Domain* template

===== Step 2: Verify Windows Domain Membership

. Navigate to the `windows` tab
. Click *Start/Windows* → *Windows Administrative Tools* → *Active Directory Users and Computers*

You should see your Windows server listed in the domain structure.

==== RHEL Server Domain Join

===== Step 1: Configure Survey for Domain Input

Your RHEL systems also need domain membership, but first you need to create a flexible survey to specify domain information:

. Navigate to *Automation Execution* → *Templates*
. Select the *RHEL Join AD* template
. Click on the *Survey* tab

.Survey Configuration Interface

===== Step 2: Create Domain Survey Question

. Click *Create survey question*
. Configure the survey with the following details:

**Survey Configuration:**
* *Question:* `Please provide the domain to join`
* *Description:* `Domain/Forest information`
* *Answer variable name:* `domain`

. Click *Create survey question*
. Enable the survey using the toggle

===== Step 3: Execute RHEL Domain Join

. Launch the template
. When prompted, provide your DNS domain information: *[[ Instruqt-Var key="DOMAIN" hostname="control" ]]*

.Domain Join Configuration

. Click *Next* to proceed

===== Step 4: Verify Complete Domain Integration

After both Windows and RHEL domain joins complete:

. Navigate to the `windows` tab
. Open *Start/Windows* → *Windows Administrative Tools* → *Active Directory Users and Computers*
. Verify that both systems appear in the domain

[TIP]
====
Having both Windows and RHEL systems in the same domain enables centralized authentication, policy management, and simplified administration across your hybrid infrastructure.

== Code Reference

=== Active Directory User and Group Management

Here's the automation code for creating organizational units, groups, and users:

[source,yaml]
----
tasks:
  - name: Create a group in an OU
    microsoft.ad.group:
      identity: "{{ group_name }}"
      scope: global
      path: "{{ ou_path }}"
      state: present

  - name: Create users for lab
    microsoft.ad.user:
      identity: "{{ item.key }}"
      password: "{{ user_password }}"
      firstname: "{{ item.value.firstname }}"
      surname: "{{ item.value.surname }}"
      state: present
      groups:
        set:
          - "{{ group_name }}"
          - Domain Users
    loop: "{{ users_list | dict2items }}"

  - name: Create Ansible Admin
    microsoft.ad.user:
      identity: "{{ admin_user }}"
      password: "{{ admin_password }}"
      firstname: "Ansible AD"
      surname: "Administrator"
      state: present
      groups:
        set:
          - Domain Admins
          - Domain Users
----

=== Domain Membership Management

Here's the code for joining servers to the Active Directory domain:

[source,yaml]
----
tasks:
  - name: Join host to Domain
    microsoft.ad.membership:
      dns_domain_name: "{{ wins_domain }}"
      hostname: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
      domain_admin_user: Administrator
      domain_admin_password: "{{ safe_password }}"
      domain_server: "{{ hostname_cleaned }}"
      state: domain
      reboot: true
----

=== Key Components Explained

**Organizational Structure Management:**
- Creates hierarchical OU structure for logical organization
- Establishes security groups with appropriate scope
- Automates user account creation with group membership

**Domain Integration:**
- Handles both Windows and Linux domain membership
- Manages authentication credentials securely
- Implements automatic system reboots when required

**Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
- Uses microsoft.ad collection for Windows integration
- Supports hybrid environments with unified domain management
- Maintains consistent security policies across platforms

== Key Takeaways

You've successfully completed advanced Active Directory automation:

* ✅ **Organizational Structure**: Created OUs and security groups for logical resource management
* ✅ **User Account Management**: Automated user creation with appropriate group memberships
* ✅ **Hybrid Domain Integration**: Joined both Windows and Linux systems to centralized domain
* ✅ **Survey-Driven Automation**: Implemented dynamic input collection for flexible deployments
* ✅ **Security Best Practices**: Maintained secure credential handling throughout the process

== Next Steps

With your hybrid domain environment fully automated, consider these advanced scenarios:

**Identity and Access Management:**
- Implement automated user lifecycle management
- Create role-based access control (RBAC) workflows
- Develop group policy automation for compliance

**Infrastructure Scaling:**
- Build automated domain controller replication
- Implement site-based Active Directory management
- Create disaster recovery procedures for domain services

**Integration Opportunities:**
- Connect with cloud identity providers (Azure AD, AWS Directory Service)
- Implement single sign-on (SSO) across applications
- Automate certificate management for domain services

**Operational Excellence:**
- Develop monitoring and alerting for domain health
- Create automated backup and restore procedures
- Implement compliance reporting for domain policies

You've now demonstrated how Ansible can manage complex, enterprise-grade Active Directory environments while maintaining security, consistency, and operational efficiency across hybrid infrastructure platforms.
