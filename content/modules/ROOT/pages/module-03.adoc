== Scenario 02: Standardized Consistency (Final Phase)

=== Introduction

Excellent progress! You've reached the final phase of your environment deployment. With your infrastructure, domain services, and user accounts configured, it's time to deploy the actual application that will serve your development teams.

.Final Support Ticket #004

This exercise demonstrates how Ansible can orchestrate complex, multi-tier application deployments across hybrid infrastructure while ensuring high availability through load balancing.

=== Lab Environment Setup

Your DNS domain for this lab is: *[[ Instruqt-Var key="DOMAIN" hostname="control" ]]*

== Lab Exercises

=== Exercise 1: Multi-Platform Web Application Deployment

You'll deploy the same web application across both Windows and RHEL platforms, demonstrating Ansible's ability to manage heterogeneous environments with consistent results.

==== Step 1: Deploy Windows Web Application

First, let's deploy the web application on your Windows server using IIS:

. Navigate to your `aap` tab and login
. Go to *Automation Execution* → *Templates*
. Launch the *Windows Deploy WebApp* template

This automation will:
- Configure IIS web server on Windows
- Deploy application files and dependencies
- Configure proper security and access permissions
- Start necessary Windows services

==== Step 2: Verify Windows Deployment

Once the template completes:

. Navigate to the `webapp-windows` tab
. View the deployed web application

.Windows Web Application

The application should be running successfully on IIS with proper Windows-specific configuration.

==== Step 3: Deploy RHEL Web Application

Now deploy the same application on your RHEL server using Apache:

. Navigate to *Automation Execution* → *Templates*  
. Launch the *RHEL Deploy WebApp* template

This automation will:
- Configure Apache web server on RHEL
- Clone application source code from repository
- Deploy and configure application files
- Start Apache services with proper configuration

==== Step 4: Verify RHEL Deployment

Once the template completes:

. Navigate to the `webapp-rhel` tab
. View the deployed web application

.RHEL Web Application

[NOTE]
====
Both deployments use the same source application but with platform-specific configurations, demonstrating Ansible's ability to abstract deployment complexity while maintaining consistency.
====

=== Exercise 2: Load Balancer Configuration

With both application servers deployed, you need to configure load balancing to distribute traffic and provide high availability.

==== Step 1: Verify Current Load Balancer State

. Navigate to the `loadbalancer` tab
. Refresh the page

.Empty Load Balancer
image::/loadbalancer.png[Load Balancer Before Configuration]

As expected, there's nothing configured yet - the load balancer needs to be told about your application servers.

==== Step 2: Configure Load Balancer with RHEL Server

. Navigate to *Automation Execution* → *Templates*
. Launch the *Configure Loadbalancer* template
. When prompted for hostname, provide: `node01.[[ Instruqt-Var key="DOMAIN" hostname="control" ]]`

.Load Balancer Configuration
image::/hostname.png[HAProxy Configuration Input]

This will configure HAProxy to include your RHEL server in the load balancing pool.

==== Step 3: Add Windows Server to Load Balancer

. Re-run the *Configure Loadbalancer* template
. When prompted for hostname, provide: `dbserver.[[ Instruqt-Var key="DOMAIN" hostname="control" ]]`

The load balancer will now distribute traffic between both your Windows and RHEL application servers.

==== Step 4: Test Complete Application Stack

Before final testing:

. Verify each individual application server is responding correctly
. Check the `webapp-windows` tab for Windows server availability
. Check the `webapp-rhel` tab for RHEL server availability
. Navigate to the `loadbalancer` tab to test load-balanced access

The load balancer will now rotate traffic between your two application servers, providing redundancy and distributing the load.

[TIP]
====
The environment is now ready for handover to your development teams! They have a fully redundant, load-balanced web application running across hybrid infrastructure.

== Code Reference

=== HAProxy Load Balancer Configuration

Here's the automation code for configuring HAProxy load balancing:

[source,yaml]
----
tasks:
  - name: Resolve DNS server hostname to IP
    set_fact:
      host_ip: "{{ lookup('dig', host) }}"

  - name: Add static hosts to load balancer
    ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
      path: /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
      line: "server static-{{ host}} {{ host_ip }}:80 check"
      insertafter: '^## STATIC CONFIG ANSIBLE'
      state: present

  - name: Add webapp hosts to load balancer
    ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
      path: /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
      line: "server webapp-{{ host }} {{ host_ip }}:80 check"
      insertafter: '^## APP CONFIG ANSIBLE'
      state: present
    notify:
      - restart haproxy

handlers:
  - name: restart haproxy
    service:
      name: haproxy
      state: restarted
----

=== RHEL Web Application Deployment

Here's the code for deploying web applications on RHEL systems:

[source,yaml]
----
tasks:
  - name: clone a git repo
    ansible.builtin.git:
      repo: https://github.com/nmartins0611/aap25-roadshow-content.git
      dest: /tmp/repo

  - name: copy all files from one directory to another
    ansible.builtin.copy:
      src: /tmp/repo/lab-resources/
      dest: /var/www/html
      remote_src: true

  - name: Tag the page
    ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
      path: /var/www/html/index.html
      line: "This is running on the RHEL Host"
      insertafter: "<p>&copy; 2024 TMM - Where comedy lives. All rights reserved.</p>"

  - name: Start httpd service
    ansible.builtin.service:
      name: httpd
      state: started

=== Key Components Explained

**DNS Resolution and Discovery:**
- Uses Ansible's `dig` lookup to resolve hostnames to IP addresses
- Enables dynamic discovery of application servers
- Supports both static and dynamic infrastructure configurations

**Configuration Management:**

- Implements idempotent configuration changes
- Maintains configuration file structure and comments

**Service Orchestration:**
- Coordinates service restarts through handlers
- Ensures load balancer updates are applied correctly
- Maintains service availability during configuration changes

**Application Deployment:**
