== Scenario 02: Standardized Consistency

=== Introduction

Ready to dive into real automation? You've been tasked with configuring a new environment for multiple teams using standardized, consistent deployments. This scenario demonstrates how Ansible Automation Platform enables different technology teams to collaborate effectively by using pre-built playbooks and templates.

By leveraging workflow templates, job templates, and secure credential management, you'll deploy and configure everything consistently across your infrastructure, minimizing manual intervention and ensuring accuracy.

=== Lab Environment Setup

==== Access Credentials

==== Server Information

Your DNS domain for this lab is: *[[ Instruqt-Var key="DOMAIN" hostname="control" ]]*

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Server | FQDN

| Domain Controller
| windows.[[ Instruqt-Var key="DOMAIN" hostname="control" ]]

| Dev Windows Server

== Lab Exercises

=== Exercise 1: Baseline Configuration and Applications

==== Understanding the Request

.Support Ticket #001
image::/ticket01.png[Support Ticket 001]

You've received a support ticket requesting configuration updates for two Windows servers in the UAT (User Acceptance Testing) environment. The requirements include:

- Deploy a standard set of applications
- Apply specific registry changes for environment compliance
- Disable automatic updates to ensure stability
- Prevent unintended changes during testing phases

To address this request efficiently, you'll create a workflow template that combines multiple job templates into a logical, repeatable process.

==== Step 1: Create a Workflow Template

. Navigate to *Automation Execution* → *Templates*
. Click *Create template*
. Select *Create workflow job template*

===== Workflow Configuration:

* *Name:* `Windows Apps and Settings`
* *Organization:* `Default`
* *Description:* `Required Applications and Settings`
* *Inventory:* `Windows Servers`

. Click *Create workflow template*

This will open the *Workflow Visualizer* where you'll design your automation workflow.

==== Step 2: Add the First Workflow Step

. In the Workflow Visualizer, click *Add Step*

.Workflow Creation Interface
image:::/workflow_create.png[Workflow Creation]

===== First Step Configuration:

* *Node Type:* `Job Template`
* *Job Template:* `Windows Registry keys`
* *Convergence:* `Any`

. Click *Next* and *Finish*

==== Step 3: Add the Second Workflow Step

. Select the `+...+` menu on your first step
. Click *Add step and link*

.Workflow Step Linking

===== Second Step Configuration:

* *Node Type:* `Job Template`
* *Job Template:* `Windows Server Applications`
* *Status:* `Always run`
* *Convergence:* `Any`

. Click *Next* and *Finish*
. Select *Save* to save the workflow

==== Step 4: Execute the Workflow

. Navigate to *Automation Execution* → *Templates*
. Select the *Windows Apps and Settings workflow*
. Click *Launch template*

Monitor the workflow execution in the output. You'll observe how the workflow orchestrates multiple job templates:

- First: Windows Registry keys configuration (completes with green checkmark)
- Then: Windows Server Applications installation (blue spinning arrows while running)

.Workflow Execution Status

[NOTE]
====
The complete workflow takes approximately 3-4 minutes. Both Windows servers will be configured with necessary registry changes and applications required by development teams.
====

==== Step 5: Verify Application Deployment

. Click on the *Windows Server Applications* icon in the Visualizer
. Review the job output to verify deployed applications
. Notice packages like procexp, windirstat, and other development tools have been installed

=== Exercise 2: Domain Controller Configuration

==== Understanding the New Request

.Support Ticket #002
image::/ticket02.png[Support Ticket 002]

A new infrastructure request has arrived from the operations team:
- Configure one Windows server as a domain controller
- Prepare another server for database services
- Ensure compliance with organizational policies

Your Windows SMEs have provided job templates to deploy this environment consistently.

==== Step 1: Verify Current Server State

. Navigate to the `windows` tab
. Click the *Start/Windows* button and open *Server Manager*
. Select *Local Server*
. Verify the server is currently part of the default *WORKGROUP* with limited services

.Current Server Configuration
image::/workgroup.png[Workgroup Configuration]

==== Step 2: Configure Secure Credentials

. Navigate to your `aap` tab
. Go to *Automation Execution* → *Templates*
. Edit the *Windows Domain Controller* template

Your Windows team has provided an Ansible Vault for secure credential storage. This ensures Active Directory credentials remain encrypted and protected.

===== Adding Vault Credentials:

. Click *Edit template*
. In the *Credentials* section, add the *Windows Vault* credential
. Save the job template

.Vault Credential Configuration
image::/vault.png[Vault Credential Setup]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ansible Vault credentials ensure sensitive information remains encrypted and secure. You don't have direct access to the credentials, maintaining security best practices.
====

==== Step 3: Deploy Active Directory

. Launch the job template using *Launch template*
. Monitor the output as each task executes

.Domain Configuration Process
image::/dnsdomain.png[DNS Domain Configuration]

The template will display the domain/forest information generated by the environment. Record this domain detail for future reference.

[NOTE]
====
This process takes several minutes to deploy Active Directory and reboot the system. After reboot, default Group Policies will also be applied.
====

==== Step 4: Verify Domain Controller Configuration

After the system reboots:

. Click *Start/Windows* and open *Server Manager*
. Verify the domain now reflects your DNS domain from the template output
. Confirm that *DNS* and *Active Directory* services are running

.Active Directory Services

=== Exercise 3: RHEL Server Deployment

==== Expanding Infrastructure

With Active Directory configured and Windows servers deployed, the next step involves deploying a RHEL system for streaming applications. Your standardized build templates will streamline this process.

[NOTE]
====
This exercise simulates provisioning tasks. In production environments, you would customize instance configurations to meet specific requirements.
====

==== Step 1: Review Current Inventory

. Navigate to *Automation Execution* → *Infrastructure* → *Inventories*
. Examine existing inventories:
  - Network environments
  - Windows environments  
  - Video Platform Inventory (currently contains only a loadbalancer group)

.Current Inventory State
image::/invbefore.png[Inventory Before Deployment]

You need to deploy a RHEL system and configure a webservers group for future use.

==== Step 2: Deploy New Node

. Navigate to *Automation Execution* → *Templates*
. Launch the *Deploy Node* template
. When prompted for the node name, enter: `node01`
. Submit the job

[TIP]
====
In this simulated environment, we use configuration as code to build inventory. With inventory plugins, you could synchronize against an inventory source.
====

==== Step 3: Verify Inventory Updates

. Once the job completes, navigate to *Automation Execution* → *Infrastructure* → *Inventories*
. Observe the new *webservers* group with your new node in the *Video Platform Inventory*
